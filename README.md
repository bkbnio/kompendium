# Kompendium

## What is Kompendium

Kompendium is intended to be a non-intrusive OpenApi Specification generator for [Ktor](https://ktor.io).
Non-invasive meaning that users will use only Ktor native functions when implementing their API, and will supplement
with Kompendium code in order to generate the appropriate spec.
