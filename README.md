# Kompendium

## What is Kompendium

Kompendium is intended to be a minimally invasive OpenApi Specification generator for [Ktor](https://ktor.io). 
Minimally invasive meaning that users will use only Ktor native functions when implementing their API, and will 
supplement with Kompendium code in order to generate the appropriate spec. 

## How to install

Kompendium uses GitHub packages as its repository.  Installing with Gradle is pretty painless.  In your `build.gradle.kts`
add the following 

```kotlin
// 1 Setup a helper function to import any Github Repository Package
// This step is optional but I have a bunch of stuff stored on github so I find it useful üòÑ
fun RepositoryHandler.github(packageUrl: String) = maven { 
    name = "GithubPackages"
    url = uri(packageUrl)
    credentials { // TODO Not sure this is necessary for public repositories?
      username = java.lang.System.getenv("GITHUB_USER")
      password = java.lang.System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
    } 
}

// 2 Add the repo in question (in this case Kompendium)
repositories {
    github("https://maven.pkg.github.com/lg-backbone/kompendium")
}

// 3 Add the package like any normal dependency
dependencies { 
    implementation("org.leafygreens:kompendium-core:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}

```

## In depth

### Warning üö®
Kompendium is still under active development ‚ö†Ô∏è There are a number of yet-to-be-implemented features, including 

- Sealed Class / Polymorphic Support üò¨  
- Validation / Enforcement (‚ùìüëÄ‚ùì)

If you have a feature that is not listed here, please open an issue!

In addition, if you find any üêûüò± please open an issue as well!

### Notarized Routes 

Kompendium introduces the concept of `notarized` HTTP methods.  That is, for all your `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
operations, there is a corresponding `notarized` method.  These operations are strongly typed, and use reification for 
a lot of the class based reflection that powers Kompendium.  Generally speaking the three types that a `notarized` method
will consume are

- `TParam`: Used to notarize expected request parameters
- `TReq`: Used to build the object schema for a request body
- `TResp`: Used to build the object schema for a response body

`GET` and `DELETE` take `TParam` and `TResp` while `PUT` and `POST` take all three.


In addition to standard HTTP Methods, Kompendium also introduced the concept of `notarizedExceptions`.  Using the `StatusPage`
extension, users can notarize all handled exceptions, along with their respective HTTP codes and response types. 
Exceptions that have been `notarized` require two types as supplemental information

- `TErr`: Used to notarize the exception being handled by this use case.  Used for matching responses at the route level.
- `TResp`: Same as above, this dictates the expected return type of the error response.  

In keeping with minimal invasion, these extension methods all consume the same code block as a standard Ktor route method,
meaning that swapping in a default Ktor route and a Kompendium `notarized` route is as simple as a single method change.

### Supplemental Annotations

In general, Kompendium tries to limit the number of annotations that developers need to use in order to get an app 
integrated.   

Currently, the annotations used by Kompendium are as follows 

- `KompendiumField`
- `KompendiumParam`

The intended purpose of `KompendiumField` is to offer field level overrides such as naming conventions (ie snake instead of camel).

The purpose of `KompendiumParam` is to provide supplemental information needed to properly assign the type of parameter 
(cookie, header, query, path) as well as other parameter-level metadata. 

## Examples

The full source code can be found in the `kompendium-playground` module. Here is a simple get endpoint example 

```kotlin
// Minimal API Example
fun Application.mainModule() {
  install(StatusPages) {
    notarizedException<Exception, ExceptionResponse>(
      info = ResponseInfo(
        KompendiumHttpCodes.BAD_REQUEST,
        "Bad Things Happened"
      )
    ) {
      call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, ExceptionResponse("Why you do dis?"))
    }
  }
  routing {
    openApi(oas)
    redoc(oas)
    swaggerUI()
    route("/potato/spud") {
      notarizedGet(simpleGetInfo) {
        call.respond(HttpStatusCode.OK)
      }
    }
  }
}

val simpleGetInfo = GetInfo<Unit, ExampleResponse>(
  summary = "Example Parameters",
  description = "A test for setting parameter examples",
  responseInfo = ResponseInfo(
    status = 200,
    description = "nice",
    examples = mapOf("test" to ExampleResponse(c = "spud"))
  ),
  canThrow = setOf(Exception::class)
)
```

### Kompendium Auth and security schemes

There is a separate library to handle security schemes: `kompendium-auth`. 
This needs to be added to your project as dependency.

At the moment, the basic and jwt authentication is only supported.

A minimal example would be:
```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
  notarizedBasic("basic") {
    realm = "Ktor realm 1"
    // configure basic authentication provider..
  }
  notarizedJwt("jwt") {
    realm = "Ktor realm 2"
    // configure jwt authentication provider...
  }
}
routing {
  authenticate("basic") {
    route("/basic_auth") {
      notarizedGet(basicAuthGetInfo) {
        call.respondText { "basic auth" }
      }
    }
  }
  authenticate("jwt") {
    route("/jwt") {
      notarizedGet(jwtAuthGetInfo) {
        call.respondText { "jwt" }
      }
    }
  }
}

val basicAuthGetInfo = MethodInfo<Unit, ExampleResponse>(
  summary = "Another get test", 
  description = "testing more", 
  responseInfo = testGetResponse, 
  securitySchemes = setOf("basic")
)
val jwtAuthGetInfo = basicAuthGetInfo.copy(securitySchemes = setOf("jwt"))
```

### Enabling Swagger ui
To enable Swagger UI, `kompendium-swagger-ui` needs to be added.
This will also add the [ktor webjars feature](https://ktor.io/docs/webjars.html) to your classpath as it is required for swagger ui.
Minimal Example:
```kotlin
  install(Webjars)
  routing {
    openApi(oas)
    swaggerUI()
  }
```

### Enabling ReDoc
Unlike swagger, redoc is provided (perhaps confusingly, in the `core` module).  This means out of the box with `kompendium-core`, you can add 
[ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) as follows

```kotlin
routing {
  openApi(oas)
  redoc(oas)
}
```

## Limitations

### Kompendium as a singleton

Currently, Kompendium exists as a Kotlin object.  This comes with a couple perks, but a couple downsides.  Primarily,
it offers a seriously clean UX where the implementer doesn't need to worry about what instance to send data to. The main
drawback, however, is that you are limited to a single API per classpath.  

If this is a blocker, please open a GitHub issue, and we can start to think out solutions!
