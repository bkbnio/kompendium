# Kompendium

## What is Kompendium

Kompendium is intended to be a minimally invasive OpenApi Specification generator for [Ktor](https://ktor.io). 
Minimally invasive meaning that users will use only Ktor native functions when implementing their API, and will 
supplement with Kompendium code in order to generate the appropriate spec. 

## How to install

Kompendium uses GitHub packages as its repository.  Installing with Gradle is pretty painless.  In your `build.gradle.kts`
add the following 

```kotlin
// 1 Setup a helper function to import any Github Repository Package
// This step is optional but I have a bunch of stuff stored on github so I find it useful üòÑ
fun RepositoryHandler.github(packageUrl: String) = maven { 
    name = "GithubPackages"
    url = uri(packageUrl)
    credentials { // TODO Not sure this is necessary for public repositories?
      username = java.lang.System.getenv("GITHUB_USER")
      password = java.lang.System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
    } 
}

// 2 Add the repo in question (in this case Kompendium)
repositories {
    github("https://maven.pkg.github.com/lg-backbone/kompendium")
}

// 3 Add the package like any normal dependency
dependencies { 
    implementation("org.leafygreens:kompendium-core:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}

```

## In depth

### Warning üö®
Kompendium is still under active development ‚ö†Ô∏è There are a number of yet-to-be-implemented features, including 

- Query and Path Parameters üîç
- Tags üè∑
- Multiple Responses üìú
- Security Schemas üîè
- Sealed Class / Polymorphic Support üò¨  
- Validation / Enforcement (‚ùìüëÄ‚ùì)

If you have a feature that is not listed here, please open an issue!

### Notarized Routes 

Kompendium introduces the concept of `notarized` HTTP methods.  That is, for all your `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
operations, there is a corresponding `notarized` method.  These operations are strongly typed, and use reification for 
a lot of the class based reflection that powers Kompendium.  Generally speaking the three types that a `notarized` method
will consume are

- `TParam`: Held for future implementations, will allow Kompendium to register information on path and query parameters
- `TReq`: Used to build the object schema for a request body
- `TResp`: Used to build the object schema for a response body

`GET` and `DELETE` take `TParam` and `TResp` while `PUT` and `POST` take all three.

In keeping with minimal invasion, these extension methods all consume the same code block as a standard Ktor route method,
meaning that swapping in a default Ktor route and a Kompendium `notarized` route is as simple as a single method change.

### Supplemental Annotations

In general, Kompendium tries to limit the number of annotations that developers need to use in order to get an app 
integrated.   

Currently, there is only a single Kompendium annotation

- `KompendiumField`

The intended purpose is to offer field level overrides such as naming conventions (ie snake instead of camel).

## Examples

The full source code can be found in the `kompendium-playground` module.  Here we show just the adjustments 
needed to a standard Ktor server to get up and running in Kompendium.  

```kotlin
// Minimal API Example
fun main() {
  embeddedServer(
    Netty,
    port = 8081,
    module = Application::mainModule
  ).start(wait = true)
}

fun Application.mainModule() {
  install(ContentNegotiation) {
    jackson {
      enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT)
      setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
    }
  }
  routing {
    openApi()
    redoc()
    route("/test") {
      route("/{id}") {
        notarizedGet<ExampleParams, ExampleResponse>(testIdGetInfo) {
          call.respondText("get by id")
        }
      }
      route("/single") {
        notarizedGet<ExampleRequest, ExampleResponse>(testSingleGetInfo) {
          call.respondText("get single")
        }
        notarizedPost<ExampleParams, ExampleRequest, ExampleCreatedResponse>(testSinglePostInfo) {
          call.respondText("test post")
        }
        notarizedPut<ExampleParams, ExampleRequest, ExampleCreatedResponse>(testSinglePutInfo) {
          call.respondText { "hey" }
        }
        notarizedDelete<Unit, DeleteResponse>(testSingleDeleteInfo) {
          call.respondText { "heya" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When run in the playground, this would output the following at `/openapi.json`

## Limitations

### Kompendium as a singleton

Currently, Kompendium exists as a Kotlin object.  This comes with a couple perks, but a couple downsides.  Primarily,
it offers a seriously clean UX where the implementer doesn't need to worry about what instance to send data to. The main
drawback, however, is that you are limited to a single API per classpath.  

If this is a blocker, please open a GitHub issue, and we can start to think out solutions!
