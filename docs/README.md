# Kompendium

Kompendium is intended to be a non-invasive OpenAPI spec generator for [Ktor](https://ktor.io) APIs. By operating
entirely through Ktor's plugin architecture, Kompendium allows you to incrementally document your API without requiring
you to rip out and replace the amazing code you have already written.

## Compatibility

Earlier versions of Kompendium targeted Ktor 1 and OpenAPI spec 3.0.  These docs however, are exclusively focused on 
Kompendium 3+, which supports Ktor 2, and outputs OpenAPI 3.1 compliant specs

| Kompendium | Ktor | OpenAPI | 
|------------|------|---------|
| 1.X        | 1    | 3.0     |
| 2.X        | 1    | 3.0     |
| 3.X        | 2    | 3.1     | 

## Getting Started

Uhh... hello?
